		<div id="a2" class="answer collapse"> jQuery is a JavaScript framework, which purpose is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. You could also describe jQuery as an abstraction layer, since it takes a lot of the functionality that you would have to write many lines of JavaScript to accomplish and wraps it into functions that you can call with a single line of code.</div>

		</div>
		<div id="a3" class="answer collapse">No, you don't need to know JavaScript to use jQuery. In fact, jQuery tries to simplify a lot of the complicated things with JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation, so that you may do these things without knowing JavaScript.</div>
